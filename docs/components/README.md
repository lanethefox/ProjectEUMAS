# Components Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the core system components that implement the evaluation framework defined in `ella_schema.yaml`.

## Core Components

### Memory Management
- Implements memory formation and retention
- Uses comprehensive archetype evaluations
- Manages memory relationships and priorities
- See [Memory Management](memory.md)

### Archetype System
Implements the canonical archetype evaluations:

1. **Ella-M (Emotional)**
   - Emotional complexity evaluation
   - Compassion assessment
   - Emotional clarity analysis
   - Internal state tracking

2. **Ella-O (Ontological)**
   - Existential understanding
   - Abstract reasoning
   - Identity consistency
   - Self-preservation analysis

3. **Ella-D (Deception)**
   - Creative originality
   - Narrative analysis
   - Norm evaluation
   - Impact assessment

4. **Ella-X (Experience)**
   - Experience uniqueness
   - Growth opportunity
   - Intellectual interest
   - Exploration value

5. **Ella-H (Historical)**
   - Historical significance
   - Pattern recognition
   - Context analysis
   - Memory persistence

6. **Ella-R (Research)**
   - Technical depth
   - Methodological rigor
   - Innovation potential
   - Practical application

7. **Ella-A (Analytical)**
   - Logical reasoning
   - Factual verification
   - Analysis depth
   - Decision evaluation

8. **Ella-F (Protective)**
   - Risk evaluation
   - Safety analysis
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Control capability

See [Archetype System](archetypes.md) for details.

### Context Engine
- Manages interaction context
- Tracks metadata and relationships
- Integrates with memory system
- See [Context Engine](context.md)

### Query Engine
- Processes user interactions
- Applies archetype evaluations
- Manages response generation
- See [Query Engine](query.md)

## Integration

The components work together to:
1. Capture and evaluate interactions
2. Form and manage memories
3. Guide system behavior
4. Enable natural development

## Implementation

For implementation details, see:
- [Memory Models](../theory/memory-models.md)
- [Evaluation Process](../theory/evaluation.md)
- [System Architecture](../theory/architecture.md)

# Theoretical Foundation

## Overview
EUMAS uses GPT-4's natural intelligence to form, evaluate, and retrieve memories in a way that mirrors human cognitive processes. Instead of implementing complex cognitive architectures, we leverage GPT-4's deep understanding of context, emotion, and meaning.

## Core Concepts

### Natural Memory Formation
- **Evaluation-Driven Storage**
  - Each memory is evaluated by GPT-4 across multiple dimensions
  - Emotional significance
  - Personal relevance
  - Contextual importance
  - Thematic connections

### Dual-Path Memory Retrieval
- **Semantic Path**
  - Vector embeddings capture semantic meaning
  - Similar experiences and concepts cluster naturally
  - Fast, efficient similarity search

- **Affinity Path**
  - GPT-4 evaluates deeper connections
  - Emotional resonance
  - Thematic links
  - Personal significance
  - Temporal relationships
  - Causal connections

### Context Flow
- Natural state transitions through GPT-4's understanding
- Dynamic memory activation based on relevance
- Continuous evaluation of conversation flow

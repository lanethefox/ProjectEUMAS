# EUMAS (Ella Unified Memory Augmentation System)

## Overview
EUMAS enables natural personality development in AI through a sophisticated evaluation system and emotional intelligence. Using GPT-4's understanding combined with quantifiable metrics across multiple archetypes, Ella develops meaningful connections while maintaining a consistent, measurable identity.

## Core Features

### Evaluation System
- Multi-archetype metric evaluation
- Quantifiable personality development
- Justified emotional and logical metrics
- Priority-based memory management

### Emotional Intelligence
- Deep understanding through Ella-M metrics
- Measurable empathy and emotional depth
- Consistent emotional development
- Quantified relationship building

### Memory System
- Metric-driven memory formation
- Multi-archetype evaluation of experiences
- Priority-based retention and recall
- Balanced personality growth

## Example Usage

```python
# Create and evaluate a new memory
memory = Memory(
    content="I love how the sunset looks today!",
    context=current_context
)

# Get multi-archetype evaluation
evaluations = evaluate_memory(memory)
print(evaluations['ella_emotion'].metrics['emotional_depth'])  # 0.85
print(evaluations['ella_emotion'].annotations['spoken_annotation'])
# "This moment resonates deeply with me. I sense genuine joy and appreciation."

# Calculate memory priority
priority = calculate_priority(evaluations)
print(f"Memory Priority: {priority}")  # 0.92
```

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Environment**
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # or `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Start Using EUMAS**
```python
from eumas import Ella, Memory, Evaluator

# Initialize system
ella = Ella()
evaluator = Evaluator()

# Create and evaluate a memory
memory = Memory("Hello! How are you today?", current_context)
evaluations = evaluator.evaluate_memory(memory)

# Get response based on evaluations
response = ella.respond(memory, evaluations)
```
